### Now?

#### October '23
Exploring Nix/NixOS. I have started using NixOS to manage the Raspberry Pis in my Homelab. I've also started contributing back to nixpkgs with helping maintaining smaller packages. Right now, working on packaging the Malayalam fonts from [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing](https://smc.org.in) into nixpkgs.
